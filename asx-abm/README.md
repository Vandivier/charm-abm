# AgentScript-next Repository

This npm package is a wild fork of ASX.

The purpose of this fork is to facilitate usage of asx as an `npm install`'ed library.

The true ASX repo maintained by [backspaces](https://github.com/backspaces) can be found [here](https://github.com/backspaces/asx).

This wild fork for NPM is a frozen release published by Vandivier, found [here](https://github.com/Vandivier/asx).

ASX is the next version of the [AgentScript 1.0](http://agentscript.org) Agent Based Modeling framework.

## Developer Information

* via bash, `npm install asx-abm`
* in your JS, `const AS = require('asx-abm');` or `import AS as * from 'asx-abm';`

For an example on the usage of this library, see this frozen branch release of [charm-abm v0.0.3](https://github.com/Vandivier/charm-abm/tree/asx-as-lib-mvp).

You may or may not be able to look at the [latest master branch revision](https://github.com/Vandivier/charm-abm) from charm-abm as well.

Or cut to the good stuff and view a running model via gh-pages [here](https://vandivier.github.io/asx/models/?diffuse).

You can view a gh-pages model running off of backspace's main repo [here](https://backspaces.github.io/asx/models/?diffuse).
